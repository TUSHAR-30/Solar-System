# Solar-System
This project is a 3D Solar System simulation built using Three.js. It features a dynamic, interactive visualization of planets orbiting around the Sun, along with moons, an asteroid belt, and background stars. Users can explore the solar system using interactive camera controls.

## üöÄ Features
- **Sun and Planets:** The simulation includes the Sun and all eight planets with accurate relative sizes and distances.
- **Moons:** Some planets have moons orbiting around them. 
- **Asteroid Belt:** A collection of small asteroids between Mars and Jupiter. 
- **Starfield:** A vast array of stars for a deep-space effect.
- **Lighting Effects:** Realistic lighting for planetary surfaces.
- **Orbiting Animation:** Planets and moons follow elliptical orbits.
- **Camera Controls:** Users can explore the scene with zoom and rotation features.
